        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Sandra Keng, and I am passionate about sharing the rich culinary heritage of Cameroon with the world. 
            As a proud Cameroonian, I aim to promote our unique flavors and traditions, encouraging everyone to experience the joy of our food.
            Growing up in Cameroon, food was more than just a necessity—it was a central part of our culture, a way to connect with family, friends, and community. Every dish tells a story, and every ingredient holds a deep connection to our history, landscapes, and way of life.
            As a proud Cameroonian, I have always been inspired by the rich tapestry of flavors, spices, and techniques that define our cuisine. From the coastal regions with their fresh seafood and coconut-rich dishes to the savannahs where hearty stews and porridges warm the soul, Cameroonian food reflects the incredible diversity of our nation. Each meal is an opportunity to share a piece of our culture, our traditions, and our identity.

        </p>
        <p>
            This website is my effort to celebrate Cameroonian cuisine and bring people together through the universal love of food.
            Through this website, my mission is to share the beauty and richness of Cameroonian cuisine with the world. Whether you are a food enthusiast looking to explore new flavors, a Cameroonian in the diaspora longing for a taste of home, or someone simply curious about African food, this platform is for you. I aim to make our dishes accessible to everyone, from traditional recipes passed down through generations to modern twists that bring a fresh perspective to our beloved flavors.
            Cooking, for me, is a form of storytelling and a way to bridge cultures. It’s about preserving the past while embracing the future, celebrating the ingredients that grow in our fertile lands, and honoring the hands that prepare each meal with love. I believe food has the power to bring people together, to spark conversations, and to create lasting memories.

        </p>
        <p>This website is more than just a collection of recipes—it’s a celebration of the spirit of Cameroon. It’s my way of inviting you to pull up a chair at the table, share in our traditions, and experience the joy that comes from preparing and savoring a delicious meal. I hope you find inspiration here to cook, to learn, and to appreciate the beauty of Cameroonian cuisine.
            Thank you for joining me on this culinary journey. Together, let’s explore the flavors, stories, and traditions that make Cameroonian food so special. Happy cooking and bon appétit!
        </p>
